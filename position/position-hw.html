            <p>The 10-Step is more than a routineâ€”it's a lifestyle that has become a global phenomenon, grounded in Korea's cultural obsession with healthy skin and backed by decades of scientific advancement. It's not about having more products than you
                can count, but rather about having the right products that do the right things, and using them in the right order.</p>

                <h2>OIL CLEANSER</h2>
                <p>Oil cleansers are the base of the Korean skin care routine and the first step of the double cleanse. They're not only relaxing to use; as you gently massage these cleansers in, they also remove makeup and draw out other oil-based impurities,
                    such as sebum, SPF, and pollution.</p>
                <div>
                    <h3>What it does</h3>
                    <p>Breaks down oil-based debris such as makeup and sunscreen</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>How to</h3>
                    <p>Morning and night, gently massage into dry skin, add lukewarm water to emulsify, then rinse.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Water Based Cleanser</h2>
                <p>The second step of the double cleanse. Cleansing twice is recommended by aestheticians and dermatologists because it helps to thoroughly remove any impurities that can cause breakouts. Water-based cleansers dissolve the water-based impurities
                    such as dirt and sweat that your oil cleanser didn't pick up.</p>
