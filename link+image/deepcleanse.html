<h2>THE DEEP CLEANSE</h2>
<p>$38<br/>
    A daily gel cleanser with natural fruit exfoliant that deeply but gently lifts impurities and unclogs pores, while leaving skin soft and hydrated.<br/>
    SIZE:  150 ML | 5 FL. OZ.</p>

<h3>Why It Works</h3>
<p>The Deep Cleanse oil-free gel lathers into a creamy foam to lift away dirt, oil and impurities without over-drying. It cleanses with amino acids derived from silk gentle enough for even the most delicate skin, leaving skin soft, refreshed and comfortably hydrated.</p>

<p>The formula harnesses the power of the Japanese Luffa fruit, a natural beauty multi-tasker beloved by Japanese women for centuries. Ground fibers from the fruit exfoliate, helping to turn over dead skin cells, deeply purifying & decongesting pores, while the fruit extract beautifies and conditions skin.</p>

<p>Japanese Wild Rose works to visibly tighten pores and smooth skin texture, while Japanese Leopard Lily helps minimize excess oil.</p>
