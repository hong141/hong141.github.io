<h4>Japanese Wild Rose</h4>
<p>In traditional Eastern medicine, Japanese Wild Rose is used to bring the body back into balance, improve circulation and even calm the spirit. We found that the antioxidant-rich fruits of this fragrant blossom can balance skin and diminish the look of pores.</p>

<h4>Japanese Leopard Lily</h4>
<p>Found on the cool hillsides of Japan, this bright bloom has been prized for centuries. Used to decorate the streets of Kyoto’s geisha district during the Gion Festival, Japanese Leopard Lily has earned the name “the flower of Kyoto.” We’ve harnessed its special powers to help minimize excess oil production, calm problem skin, and promote turnover of the skin.</p>

<h4>Hadasei-3 Complex</h4>
<p>This trio of antioxidant-rich Japanese superfoods reveals soft, healthy-looking skin. Featuring Uji Green Tea (known to detoxify and help prevent signs of premature aging), Okinawa Red Algae (rich in polysaccharides, essential for skin water retention and renewal), and Akita Rice (a nourishing moisturizer, rich in essential proteins).</p>
