    Mineral oil, synthetic fragrances, sulfate detergents, parabens, urea, DEA, TEA or phthalates.</p>

<h4>Japanese Purple Rice</h4>
<p>Purple rice, an ancient precious rice first beloved in Japan, packed with nutrients and known for its ability to survive any harsh environment, has long been used to celebrate longevity and vitality. Rich in anthocyanin, a strong antioxidant, it helps skin recover from and protect against stress, pollution, and UV damage for healthier-looking skin.</p>

<h4>Okinawa Algae Blend + Hyaluronic Acid</h4>
<p>A special blend of Okinawa algae and hyaluronic acid captures water to help replenish skin’s natural moisture reservoir, immediately leaving skin soft, comforted, and deeply nourished. It also helps to replenish ceramides to ensure optimum skin barrier function, aiding in the reduction of future moisture loss, for skin that is visibly smooth and plump with hydration.</p>

<h4>Botanical Extracts</h4>
<p>A blend of extracts and oils from ginseng, wild thyme, and sweet marjoram nourishes skin, enhancing its natural ability to retain and release moisture as needed, and imparts a dewy glow.</p>
