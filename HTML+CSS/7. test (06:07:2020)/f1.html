        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>A show-stopping lilac-blue semi-dinnerplate variety brings a unique color to the world of Dahlias. These well-formed flowers provide dramatic color in the border for many months from midsummer.</p>

        <h3>Planting Guides</h3>
        <p>Summer Blooming Bulbs, including popular varieties such as gladiolus and dahlias, are planted in the spring and bloom in the summer. Most of these bulbs are tropical and require warm weather to be planted. There must not be any danger of frost
            and your ground temperature must have reached 55 degrees Fahrenheit before planting. Many of our summer blooming bulbs can be planted as perennials in zones 9-10 (zone 8 if mulched), but should be treated as annuals in cooler climates. You
            can lift them and store them in the fall, or bring patio pots inside before frost. See page 15 of our Planting Guide for a bulb depth planting illustration. Read our article about How To Grow Dahlias.</p>
        <p>Growing Dahlias: Plant Dahlia tubers after spring frosts in good garden soil with full sun. Dahlias must be protected from high winds, so we suggest you position them against a wall or be ready to stake them. Keep the plants well-watered and free
            of bugs, applying flower fertilizer as they grow. Your dahlias will be in full bloom by July or August, with the enormous flowers continuing to bloom until frost. As frost threatens, pull up the roots and trim off the stems. You can store
            the tubers in a cool dry place until the following spring.</p>
