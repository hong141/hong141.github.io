        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>Rubinstern (Ruby Star) is a German bred cultivar with deeply colored rose-red petals that stretch out horizontilly from the center cone. A vigorous long bloomer with some of the darkest flowers you'll see on a purple coneflower.</p>

        <h3>Planting Guides</h3>
        <p>This genus is invaluable for the mid- to late-summer garden, bringing color into our plantings when many spring bloomers have gone green for the season. They are native to the eastern half of the U.S. and are most commonly found growing in prairie
            habitats.
        </p>
        <p>Echinacea thrive in our gardens when provided with well drained soils, plenty of sunshine and moderate to dry moisture conditions depending on the species and cultivars. Healthy individual coneflowers will grow in the garden for 3 to 5 years.
            Species and cultivars raised from seed will often reseed themselves to continue their presence in our gardens.
