        <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>Magnus is a distinctive, vigorous and large growing cone flower cultivar. The bright reddish-pink petals of its huge flowers are held flat as they radiate out from the cone, instead of curving backwards as is typical of most coneflowers.</p>

        <h3>Planting Guides</h3>
        <p>This genus is invaluable for the mid- to late-summer garden, bringing color into our plantings when many spring bloomers have gone green for the season. They are native to the eastern half of the U.S. and are most commonly found growing in prairie
            habitats.
        </p>
        <p>Echinacea thrive in our gardens when provided with well drained soils, plenty of sunshine and moderate to dry moisture conditions depending on the species and cultivars. Healthy individual coneflowers will grow in the garden for 3 to 5 years.
            Species and cultivars raised from seed will often reseed themselves to continue their presence in our gardens.
